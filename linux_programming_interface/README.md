# Linux programming interface:

Practice coding the Linux programming interface, the system calls, library functions, and other low-level interfaces
provided by Linux, a free implementation of the UNIX operating system. They allow applications to perform tasks such 
as file I/O, creating and deleting files and directories, creating new processes, exxecuting programs, communicating between
processes and threads. This set of low-level interfaces is sometimes also known as the system prrogramming interface
