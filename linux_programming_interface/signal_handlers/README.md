# Signal Handlers

### 1. [Ouch.c](https://github.com/danghai/C-projects-and-Data-Structure/blob/master/linux_programming_interface/signal_handlers/ouch.c)

ouch.c: it is a simple example of a signal handler function and a main
program that establishes it as the handler for the SIGINT signal. (The terminal
driver generates this signal when we type the terminal interrupt character, usually
Control-C). The handler simply prints a message Ouch and returns

```
danghai@ubuntu:~$ ./ouch
0
1
2
^C    Ouch!
3
4
^C    Ouch!
5
```
### 2. [intquit.c](https://github.com/danghai/C-projects-and-Data-Structure/blob/master/linux_programming_interface/signal_handlers/intquit.c)

intquit.c: This program establishes the same handler for SIGINT
and SIGQUIT (SIGQUIT is generated by the terminal driver) when we type the
terminal quit character, usually Control -\.) The code of the handler distinguishes
the two signals by examining the sig argument, and takes different actions for each
signal. In the main() function, we use pause() to block the process until a signal is caught

```
danghai@ubuntu:~$ ./intquit
^C  Caught SIGINT (0) !
^C  Caught SIGINT (1) !
^C  Caught SIGINT (2) !
^C  Caught SIGINT (3) !
^\  Caught SIGQUIT - that's all folks
```
