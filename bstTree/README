Source code of the C++ Program to demonstrate Binary Search Tree:

1.Insert element into the BST"<<endl;
2.Search element from the BST"<<endl;
3.Delete element at a BST"<<endl;
4.Display all element in the BST following traversal"<<endl;
5.Remove the maximum value in the BST" << endl;
6.Total element in BST" << endl;
7.Display BST following tree form" << endl;
8.Others " <<endl;

OTHERS include:
1.Count left node of BST: " << endl;
2.Count empty branches in BST: " << endl;
3.Count depth sum of BST: " << endl;
4.Count even branches in BST" << endl;
5.Print the value at level in BST" << endl;
6.Print the leaves in a BST from right to left" <<endl;
7.Check BST is full or not: " <<endl;
8.Double all data values greater than 0 in BST " <<endl;
9.Changes data following number node (pre-order)" <<endl;
10.Remove the leaves from BST " <<endl;
11.Complete to level the BST" <<endl;
12.Trim BST " <<endl;
13.Eliminates branch nodes that have only one child " <<endl;
