# Source code of the C++ Program to demonstrate Linked List:

### Part 1: 
[Part 1](https://github.com/danghai/C-projects-and-Data-Structure/tree/master/linkedlist/Part%201)
1. Insert a new value at the tail
2. Build a simple list number from 0 --> 9
3. Display all value in list
4. Get pointer head and tail in list
5. Sum total element in list by 2 methods ( Normal traversal and Recursive ) 
6. Add a number in a list by 2 methods ( Normal traversal and Recursive )
7. Remove a number at the tail by 2 methods (Normal traversal and Recursive )
8. Remove all elements in list
9. Find a value in list by 2 methods (Normal traversal and Recursive)
10. Copy all elemnt in a list to another list by 2 methods (Normal traversal and Recursive) 

### Part 2: 
[Part 2](https://github.com/danghai/C-projects-and-Data-Structure/tree/master/linkedlist/Part%202)
1. Implement ShuffleMerge by 2 methods (Normal traversal and Recursive)
2. Implement insertSort (increasing order)
3. Implement SortedMerge by using insertSort by 2 methods (Normal traversal and Recursive)
