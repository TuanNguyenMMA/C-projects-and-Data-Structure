# Source code of the C++ Program to demonstrate Binary Search Tree:

1. Insert element into the BST
2. Search element from the BST
3. Delete element at a BST
4. Display all element in the BST following traversal
5. Remove the maximum value in the BST
6. Total element in BST
7. Display BST following tree form
8. Others

OTHERS include:
1. Count left node of BST
2. Count empty branches in BST
3. Count depth sum of BST
4. Count even branches in BST
5. Print the value at level in BST
6. Print the leaves in a BST from right to left
7. Check BST is full or not
8. Double all data values greater than 0 in BST
9. Changes data following number node (pre-order)
10. Remove the leaves from BST
11. Complete to level the BST
12. Trim BST
13. Eliminates branch nodes that have only one child
